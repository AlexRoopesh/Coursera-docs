Steps for Git

1. Create a repository in Github with the "<name>"
2. Open Git bash 
3. git clone https://github.com/AlexRoopesh/<name>.git ## add .git to the folder name
4. cd <name> folder ## remember the folder name is <name> without the .git extension
3. copy files from R Studio console into the cloned repository
4. add files using git add . (new files), -u (updates/deletes), -A (does first two)
5. Only after 4 is done commit : git commit -m "comments" . ## This updates only the local repo
6. git push  ( to push the updates to Git hub)

if 6 doesnt work try this first and then for subsequent pushes we can use 6 again
. this is becuaseNo master exists yet on the remote (origin) repository.

6a. git push origin master
